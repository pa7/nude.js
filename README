About
nude.js is a JavaScript implementation of a nudity scanner based on approaches from research papers. HTMLCanvas makes it possible to analyse image data and afterwards decide whether it should be displayed or not. The detection algorithm runs at the client, therefore it's possible (with user interaction) to display the image even if it's identified as nude (false positive)
The real world usage for client side nudity detection could be in webproxies with child security filters, and maybe even more (e.g. on social media plattforms)
nude.js is Open Source. Contributions are very welcome, the goal is to build a reliable client-side nudity scanner.

The algorithm is mostly based on the following paper:

Demo
Test the nudity detection script on several predefined images, I didn't have enough time to build a nice demo with flickr image support but feel free to test some of your images too. nude.js is currently supported in IE9(excanvas), FF 3.6+, Chrome, Safari and Opera. For really fast results try Chrome.
